# django-channels-demo-part-2

The following repo contains code on how to build Django Channels into your application 
with endpoints created by Django REST framework. 

# Dependancies 
- Install brew from https://brew.sh/ 
- Install python and pip from brew 
- Install redis from brew: ``brew install redis``
- Start the redis service ``brew services start redis``

# Setup 
1. Create a virtual environment by running ``virtualenv env`` in the terminal. 
2. Activate this python environment: ``source env/bin/activate``
3. Install all dependancies found in the requirements.txt. From terminal, run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
4. Go into the prototype directory: ``cd prototype`` 
4. Migrate: ``python manage.py migrate``
5. Populate the database with some broadcasting channels: ``python manage.py populate_db``
5. Run the server: ``python manage.py runserver``

# Usage 

- Open up your browser and go to localhost:8000/channels. Open up the console and there is a confirmation message
  to assert the connection was successful. 
- With a tool like Postman, you can send PUT requests (as shown below) to update the database.

The results will update in real time without the client initially sending off HTTP requests!
